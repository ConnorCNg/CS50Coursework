sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: It is the slowest and scales the worst as the sample size increases for the random datasets, but it is faster than sort3 (the 2nd slowest for random datasets) when the dataset is already sorted

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: It is the fastest even as the dataset grows in size

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: It is slower than sort2 and requires the same amount of time for the random and already sorted data sets.
